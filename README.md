# Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

# Deployment
Firstly you need to clone the repository.

After you have successfully aquired the code, you need to open it inside pycharm and add an interpretor to your project.

This is done by going to File > Settings > Project > Project Interpreter

Once you have that window open you need to press the cogwheel and add a local interpretor.

After that you add the librarys in the same windows by pressing the green plus button.

You need to add Pillow-PIL and PyQt5 to your project.
